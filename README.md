# VRRacer-by-VRBoys
Futuristic VR racing game playable with Google Cardboard.

This prototype game were made in December 2015, for a 48 hour gamejam event in Viborg, Denmark.

The gameplay is simple:
- You have to avoid the edges and obstacles.
- The game speed increases automaticly when you race the track.
- If you die, you will restart at the beginning of the game.

The game project is made for Google Cardboard and ment to played on Android devices, and with a Bluetooth controller in your hands.

When we made the game back in 2015, we used a Samsung S7 phone, a VR kit made of cardboard and rubberbands, and a cheap gamepad from China, connected to the phone using Bluetooth.

# Authors
All graphics were made by Nikki Starostka, and I (Kasper FÃ¦rch Mikkelsen) did the programming and most of the scene setup.
None of the audio files were made by us, but kindly borrowed from other games.

We got inspired by Star Wars podracer and the Wipeout games for Playstation, when we made this game.

# Notes
As you can see there is *a lot* of unused code in this Unity project. The only excuse is.. well.. we had 48 hours in total to come up with a cool game idea, then make and test the game. So we had to borrow code from around the interwebz too.
